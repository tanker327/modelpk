# State Management Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Zedux Integration
The application SHALL use Zedux for atomic state management.

#### Scenario: Setup Zedux store
- **WHEN** the application initializes
- **THEN** a Zedux ecosystem SHALL be created
- **AND** the ecosystem SHALL be accessible throughout the application
- **AND** atoms SHALL be used to manage discrete pieces of state

### Requirement: Prompt State Management
The application SHALL manage prompt input state using Zedux atoms.

#### Scenario: Update prompt state
- **WHEN** a user modifies the prompt input
- **THEN** the prompt atom SHALL be updated with the new value
- **AND** all components consuming the prompt state SHALL receive the update
- **AND** the update SHALL be performed immutably

### Requirement: Model Selection State
The application SHALL manage selected models using Zedux atoms.

#### Scenario: Update selected models
- **WHEN** a user selects or deselects a model
- **THEN** the selected models atom SHALL be updated
- **AND** the selection state SHALL be reflected across all relevant components
- **AND** the state SHALL maintain a list of currently selected model identifiers

### Requirement: Model Output State
The application SHALL manage model outputs and their loading states using Zedux atoms.

#### Scenario: Update model output state
- **WHEN** a model returns a result
- **THEN** the corresponding output atom SHALL be updated with the result
- **AND** the loading state for that model SHALL be set to false
- **AND** any error state SHALL be cleared

#### Scenario: Handle loading state
- **WHEN** a model request is initiated
- **THEN** the loading state for that model SHALL be set to true
- **AND** previous output SHALL remain visible until new output is available

#### Scenario: Handle error state
- **WHEN** a model request fails
- **THEN** the error state for that model SHALL be updated with error details
- **AND** the loading state SHALL be set to false
- **AND** the error SHALL be stored in a way that allows user-friendly display
