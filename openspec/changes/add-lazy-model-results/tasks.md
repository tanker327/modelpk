# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Update Model Selection Logic

- [x] 3.2 Verify removing a model removes its result box
- [x] 3.3 Test that existing results persist when new models added

## 4. Testing
- [x] 4.1 Manual test: Add model after initial submission
- [x] 4.2 Manual test: Click refresh on new model
- [x] 4.3 Manual test: Add multiple models incrementally
