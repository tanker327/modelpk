# Capability: Results Display

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Display Side-by-Side Response Panels

The application MUST display responses from each provider/model combination in separate panels arranged side-by-side.

**Rationale**: Side-by-side layout enables easy visual comparison of responses.

#### Scenario: Multiple responses displayed

**Given** the user has submitted requests to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
**When** all responses are received
**Then** the application SHALL display three panels side-by-side
**And** each panel SHALL be clearly separated visually

#### Scenario: Mobile/narrow viewport

**Given** the viewport width is less than 768px
**When** responses are displayed
**Then** the application SHALL stack panels vertically
**And** each panel SHALL take full width

---

### Requirement: Show Provider and Model Information

The application MUST display the provider name and model name for each response panel.

**Rationale**: Users need to know which response came from which provider/model.

#### Scenario: Response panel header

**Given** a response is displayed for OpenAI / gpt-4o
**Then** the panel SHALL show "OpenAI" as the provider name
**And** the panel SHALL show "gpt-4o" as the model name
**And** both SHALL be prominently displayed at the top of the panel

---

### Requirement: Display Response Text

The application MUST display the complete response text from each model.

**Rationale**: The response text is the primary comparison data.

#### Scenario: Short response

**Given** a model returns a 100-word response
**When** displayed in the panel
**Then** the entire response SHALL be visible without scrolling

#### Scenario: Long response

**Given** a model returns a 1000-word response
**When** displayed in the panel
**Then** the panel SHALL have a maximum height
**And** the panel SHALL be scrollable to view the full response

---

### Requirement: Display Response Timing

The application MUST display the response time for each request in a human-readable format.

**Rationale**: Response time is a key comparison metric.

#### Scenario: Fast response (< 1 second)

**Given** a request completes in 450 milliseconds
**Then** the application SHALL display "450ms" or "0.45s"

#### Scenario: Slow response (> 1 second)

**Given** a request completes in 2350 milliseconds
**Then** the application SHALL display "2.35s" or "2350ms"

#### Scenario: Very fast response

**Given** a request completes in 50 milliseconds
**When** displayed to the user
**Then** the timing SHALL be shown prominently
**And** the format SHALL be consistent across all panels

---

### Requirement: Show Loading State

The application MUST show a loading indicator while waiting for each API response.

**Rationale**: Users need feedback that requests are in progress.

#### Scenario: Request in progress

**Given** an API request has been sent but not yet completed
**When** viewing the results area
**Then** the panel SHALL display a loading spinner or indicator
**And** the panel SHALL show "Loading..." or similar message

#### Scenario: One response received, others still loading

**Given** OpenAI has responded but Anthropic is still loading
**When** viewing the results area
**Then** the OpenAI panel SHALL display the response
**And** the Anthropic panel SHALL continue showing the loading indicator

---

### Requirement: Display Errors Gracefully

The application MUST display error messages clearly when API requests fail.

**Rationale**: Users need to understand why a request failed and what to do about it.

#### Scenario: API error response

**Given** an API returns an error "Invalid API key"
**When** displaying the error in the panel
**Then** the panel SHALL show an error icon or indicator
**And** the panel SHALL display "Invalid API key"
**And** the error SHALL be displayed in a distinct color (e.g., red)

#### Scenario: Network error

**Given** a network error occurs
**When** displaying the error
**Then** the panel SHALL show "Network error" or similar message
**And** the panel SHALL suggest checking internet connection

---

### Requirement: Responsive Panel Layout

The application MUST adapt panel layout based on viewport size.

**Rationale**: Users on different devices need an appropriate viewing experience.

#### Scenario: Desktop view (3 panels)

**Given** the viewport width is 1280px
**When** displaying 3 responses
**Then** the panels SHALL be arranged horizontally
**And** each panel SHALL have equal width

#### Scenario: Tablet view (2 panels)

**Given** the viewport width is 768px
**When** displaying 3 responses
**Then** the panels SHALL wrap to multiple rows
**And** each panel SHALL take approximately half the width

#### Scenario: Mobile view (1 panel per row)

**Given** the viewport width is 480px
**When** displaying responses
**Then** each panel SHALL take full width
**And** panels SHALL stack vertically
